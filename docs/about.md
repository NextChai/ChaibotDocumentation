### About the Dev
Hi, my name is Chai! I am a 15yr old Python bot developer! I mainly code in Python, but I can also code in JS, C++, and C#. I've been working on this project for around 5 months now, and have learned so much along the way! I can't wait to hear your feedback!
### About Chaibot
Chaibot was created not mainly to learn, but also because I had noticed there weren't many bots like Chaibot. I feel this project can get very big with enough time and de-bugging lol. I hope you can walk through this journey with me as time moves on. If you find a bug, report it to [Chaibot's twitter](https://twitter.com/officialchaibot) for a suprize ;)
### What's to come
In the next couple of months, I plan to get a fully supported custom matchmaking system working. Doing this however, requires a couple hundred Fortnite bots.. which will take some time to get setup. I plan to get a better stat tracker as we move on.

A big goal of mine is making the bot as user friendly as possible, so that's that I am mainly focusing on right now.
