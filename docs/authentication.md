## Authentication
Chai uses **official Epic Games' API's and endpoints** to do some really cool commands! More are in the works, so everything in this category is only going to get better with time.

### **login**
Login with Chai's assistance to Epic's Authentication API.

All commands in this category do require logging in. Doing so if very simple.

**Note:** This is a Nintendo Switch auth login. Chai is not able to access your Epic Games' Passwords, Emails, or Login Information. Chai and his Dev's go to great extent to ensure your data is kept secure.

How to use:
```
chailogin
- Click on the blue Epic Games link
- Login if needed
- Come back and click on the green check
```

Use Example:
```
chailogin
```

### **autoclaim**
Opt in to **automatically collect your STW rewards**. Chai will DM you when it has claimed them for you, notifying you of the change it made to your Epic Games account. This DM feature can not be turned off, as we want to keep it very clear what happens to your account automatically.
