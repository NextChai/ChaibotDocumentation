### **Authentication**
**Chai can claim your Fortnite Save The Reward for you:**

We've been working on this for a while, but yes, it's true! You can use a command to claim your daily Save the World reward! 

Attempting to dumb it down, Chai uses Epic Games API's to make requests for your account. These requets can be to **get your vbucks amount**, **view your gift history**, **get your arena point data**, **etc**. 

Security is something the dev takes very seriously. Chai and his dev are unable to see your login information, get your login information, or do anything to potentially breach the security of your Epic Games account. We ensure doing Chai commands are safe.


### **Account Verification:**
Chai offers Epic Games Account Verification, allowing users to **add Chai inside of Fortnite and verify their epic games account** to get a "Verified by Chai" role in your server.
 
Chai Account Verification also allows users to get each others stats' and connect to each other very easy and fast. Commands like **prcheck** and **getstat** are available by all members that have been verified. More information is available under the **Fortnite** section.
 
### **Customizable Fortnite Updates:**
Chai offers a completely custom fortnite update system, allowing you to choose between item shops, news updates, leaked cosmetics, aes updates, server stats, and more. All can be set to custom channels, allowing you to customize how you want to customize.
 
## Changeable Prefixes:
 
Chai's prefix is **completely customizeable**. You can change it from the default "chai" prefix to anything that fits your server.


## Moderation Tools:
Chai offers a complete moderation system. Complete with bans, warnings, kicks, everything you need to make someone really unhappy.
