### **Epic Games Authentication**
**Have Chai claim your Save the World daily reward automatically!**

We've been working on this for a while, but yes, it's true! You can use a command to claim your daily Save the World reward! Head on over to the **Authentication** to learn a bit more.

Commands to **get your vbucks amount**, **view your gift history**, and view your **current and past arena point counts** are all possible! 

This is a big step, and is something we're looking into developing much more in the next couple months.

### **Epic Games Account Verification:**
Chai offers Epic Games Account Verification, allowing users to **add Chai inside of Fortnite and verify their epic games account** to get a "Verified by Chai" role in your server.
 
Chai Account Verification also allows users to get each others stats' and connect to each other very easy and fast. Commands like **prcheck** and **getstat** are available by all members that have been verified. More information is available under the **Fortnite** section.
