# Welcome to Chaibot Documentation

Chaibot's commands with how-two's and examples. [https://top.gg/bot/728115804826239017](https://top.gg/bot/728115804826239017).

## How to use:
Below are all commands for Chaibot, sorted in **custom categories (cogs) for each set of commands**. Using the navigation on the left is a big help, I recommend making use of it.

Any **command in need of special permissions will be specified**. If not specification is given, the command requires no perms.

Any command that is toggleable (used once to turn on and once again to turn off) will be specified. 

The "How to Use" section.
- The how to use section will show you the name for the parameter folllowed by its type. For example: **[name: type]**

- Here's some examples of things you will see:
    ```
    discord.Member: a server member

    discord.Role:  a server role

    str: a "string" (aka a text)

    int:  a number
    ```
## Main Commands:
Command sections are seperated in cogs. You can do **chaihelp CogName** for more info on a cog. All commands are shown with the **chai** prefix, easily change out this prefix and use your own one.
